# Project Euler Problem Analysis
NOTE: This repository is not here to provide solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) but rather as a learning reference when stuck.
Please use this repository as a guide and learning material for problems that you may be stuck on.
Project Euler is a website for learning and you will gain no benefit in your math / programming ability by copying the answers provided here.

I will try and write comments and workings throughout the solutions provided in the repository to provide insight into decision making and some of the inferences that can be made from questions that appear to not contain the complete information.

I hope you enjoy doing the Project Euler problems as much as I have and hopefully this will assist you along your way.

All solutions will be written in Python. Python is 'less-efficient' than other languages but most problems on Project Euler are bound by an algorithms Big-O values rather than interpretter speed. Plus, I find Python is quick to develop small projects, which is ideal as I don't have very much time to develop this repo.
